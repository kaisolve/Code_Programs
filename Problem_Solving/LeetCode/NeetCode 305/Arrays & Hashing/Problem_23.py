# Longest Consecutive Sequence
# iving array, give the length of the most Consecutive Sequence
# // algorithm put the arr in set, and compare each item to see if it first of sequance or not
# // if then start counting and searching for the next in set, if there is no next then the length is set as before
# // if not the first then continue to next item
# // finally return the longest which is the max of previous longest and the length
# // complexity O(n)
